API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests to access backend APIs. It processes requests in two main ways: either by routing them directly to the appropriate service or by distributing (fanning out) the request to multiple services. Spring Cloud API Gateway supports one-size-fits-all style API.

## Getting Started

Spring Cloud Gateway provides 2 ways to configure the routes with gateway.

* Static Routing - User has to manually configure the route definitions in the application.yml
* Dynamic Routing - Api-registry-common has the capability to read the open api annotations mentioned on the endpoints
  and creates the route definitions and stores in postgressql database

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

The list of tools required to build and run the project:
1. Java 17
2. Apache Maven 3.8 or higher

### Installation

[How to set up Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

[Install Java](https://www.tutorials24x7.com/java/how-to-install-openjdk-17-on-windows)

### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is
integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the `validate` phase and `check` goal of the maven lifecycle and fails
the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

To run the checkstyle plugin, run the below maven command.

```mvn checkstyle:check```

### Running the tests

To run the tests for this system run the below maven command.

```mvn test```

Or run a specific test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheFirstUnitTest"```

To run a method from within a test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheSecondUnitTest#whenTestCase2_thenPrintTest2_1"```

### Deployment

We can deploy this component as a Kubernetes pod by installing api-gateway and api-registry charts.

## Architecture

## Usage

1. API-Gateway provides a robust solution for managing and routing HTTP request in microservice architecture. It
   dynamically registers routes and applies filters to validate requests and responses. Also offers built-in resilience
   and monitoring features to ensure scalable and reliable API management.

2. Spring Cloud API gateway does provide single entry point for all clients to allow access of backend APIs. The API
   gateway handles requests in one of two ways. Some requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service. It
   handles other requests by fanning out to multiple services. Spring Cloud API gateway, also provide a
   one-size-fits-all style API, the API gateway can expose a different API for each client.

3. The API gateway also implement security, e.g. verify that the client is authorized to perform the request by
   validating the Oath2 token(JWT).A variation of this pattern is the Backends for frontends pattern. It defines a
   separate API gateway for each kind of client.

4. Spring Cloud Gateway features:

* Built on Spring Framework 5, Project Reactor and Spring Boot 2.0
* Able to match routes on any request attribute.
* Predicates and filters are specific to routes.
* Circuit Breaker integration.
* Spring Cloud Discovery Client integration
* Easy to write Predicates and Filters
* Request Rate Limiting
* Path Rewriting
* Response Caching
